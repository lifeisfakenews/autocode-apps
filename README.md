# Autocode Apps

This repo contains the original code for all of my autocode apps

This is all standard lib code, which is likely not easy to run and rewrites for most of my apps are/will be avaiable soon

Currently this repo contains the following apps:
- `modmailisfakenews`, rewrite planned for July - August 2024
- `chessisfakenews`, rewrite planned for July - August 2024
- `logisfakenews`, rewrite planned for July - August 2024
- `modisfakenews`, rewrite planned for July - August 2024
- `economyisfakenews`, rewrite likely for July - August 2024
- Select Menu Roles (`select-roles`), no rewrite currently planned however it may happen
- Autocode Bot help system (`autocode-help`), no rewrite planned
    - Credit to @randomguy400 who worked on it with me
- Legal Moderation `legal-moderation`, rewrite/completion highly unlikely unless there is demand
- Sunglasses Bot (`sunglasses-bot`), no rewrite planned
- Counter Bot (`counter-bot`), rewrite available

Rewrites will likely happen in the order of the list above, although that could change

## Contributing

I wont be reading issues nor accepting pull requests unless you find a major security problem since this code is mainly just an archive of code because Autocode shut down

If you do find a security issue, email me at lifeisfakenews69@gmail.com, or message me `@lifeisfakenews` on Discord
